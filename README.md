# Enhancing Automatic Metadata Generation for YouTube Videos through Multimodal Contextual Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a novel system for automatic metadata generation for YouTube videos by leveraging multimodal contextual analysis. By integrating video, audio, and transcript data using advanced transformer-based models, the system intends to generate accurate and contextually relevant metadata—such as titles, tags, and descriptions—that improve discoverability and viewer engagement.

## Key Features

- Utilizes state-of-the-art large language models tailored for sequence-to-sequence tasks.
- Employs a multimodal approach combining video, audio, and textual information.
- Leverages precomputed features from well-established datasets.
- Designed to integrate smoothly with YouTube’s video upload interface via a browser extension.
- Evaluated with strong performance metrics to ensure quality and relevance of generated metadata.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a customized subset of the MSR-VTT dataset composed of diverse video clips, corresponding transcripts generated with automated speech recognition, and corresponding metadata annotations.

## Technologies and Tools

- Transformer architectures for natural language processing.
- Audio and video feature extraction techniques.
- Speech-to-text transcription models.
- Model training and fine-tuning frameworks.
- Browser extension development for user interface integration.

## Status

This is an ongoing research project focused on advancing methods for automatic metadata generation on video platforms. Specific implementation details and methodologies are proprietary and under active development.
